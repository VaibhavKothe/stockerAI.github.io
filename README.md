### 2. News Analysis Chatbot
Users can interact with a chatbot to retrieve insights from the scraped news without reading the articles. The chatbot can answer queries like:

- Which stocks received investments, etc.

This functionality is powered by **MongoDB Atlas** for vector search, **CosmoCloud** as the backend layer, and **Gemini AI** as the language model.
